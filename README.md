Project 1:
Given the package size, the max delay and the Prop delay of two nodes K1 and K2 we
can find the bit rate R of the link and the number of bits from the package based on a time period [t1, t2].

Project 2:
A program that finds the fastest route from a selected node from the given Node-Map
based on the choosen algorith (Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford).
